# Pill Reminder-Odin Landing Page

This project was completed as part of "The Odin Project" Foundations Course curriculum. I created a complete web page based on the provided design images. The design consisted of two images: one showcasing the complete website, and the other detailing fonts and colors used. The project focuses on replicating the design as closely as possible, utilizing HTML and CSS skills.
